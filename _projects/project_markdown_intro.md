[Lecture Notes  - An Introduction to Markdown (German)]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/introduction_markdown.pdf)
[R-Markdown File (German)]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/introduction_markdown.Rmd)

In 2018 while I was teaching statistics for mathematicians, I spontaneously decided to give a (very) brief introduction to ```Markdown``` and ```Bookdown``` within ```R-Studio```. The notes and the corresponding markdown file can be found here.
