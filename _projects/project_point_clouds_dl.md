[Slides - Point Clouds and Deep Learning]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/point_clouds_dl.pdf)

In 2023 I was an invited speaker at the Master of Data Science programme at the University of Innsbruck.

I briefly gave an overview about the challenges regarding 3D point clouds and deep learning techniques and then discussed the celebrated [Pointnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) and [FoldingNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07262) as well as our paper [Cluster-Based Autoencoders for Volumetric Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01009).
