[Slides - Abstract Operator Systems over the Cone of Positive Semidefinite Matrices]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/os_spec.pdf)

In 2022 I gave a talk about our paper [Abstract Operator Systems over the Cone of Positive Semidefinite Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14453)

I discussed the definitions of abstract operator systems and their concrete realization and the notion of free spectrahedra and how they relate too each other. Then I presented our results regarding the operator systems over the cone of positive semidefinite matrices.
